# REHEARSAL SERIES: choreo-graphic-code @MediaLab-Prado


The [Choreographic Code](http://pzwart1.wdka.hro.nl/~jo/notebook/series/glossary.html) will take the format of a series of rehearsals in which a cross-disciplinary exploration of choreography & code will take place. By ‘rehearsal’ it is meant a sort of temporary stage for experimenting with web design tools by following choreographic methods and thematic concerns. This format is very similar to open workshops, open to any participants curious to explore the use of choreographic techniques to generate newness in design, new modes of thinking composition matters, participation, relations and articulations between bodies and technologies. Traditionally, a rehearsal is a built in process, a space and time for developing ideas and work acknowledging unexpected and unpredictable results. Another important point about this rehearsal series is to break the distancing between mind/body, self/other, subject/object, designer/design piece; discovery/invention. Enhancing the idea of process over product: processes of becoming, becoming structures, becoming codes and scripts. In every rehearsal a selection of topics will be addressed and will serve as starting point to the construction of a choreographic code. During the rehearsals, the participants will be presented to various choreographic references, examples of scores and scripts, and participate in basic movement studies. Finally all participants are invited to contribute to the choreographic code: by translating the ideas discussed into html/css/javascript functions. In the end, the choreographic code will be compiled, and made public: online (on github); and will be demonstrated in a final presentation.


## Practical Approach:

**Actual physical space.**


_Embodiment: exercises to warm up; simple movement sequences; creation of situations for collective and individual awareness of the bodies, the space, and the different rhythms._

The exercises take as its starting point the condition of our bodies and the movements we carry in our body history, our body relationship to cultural codes, private investigations of what are our basic movements, the proximity to ordinary, daily movemen. Reaching the question of how default movement can be challenged by choreographic thought.

_Following the media theorist Brian Massumi’s “thinking-feeling of what happens”. An expansion of perception brings us into “affective co-motion”: by opening us to more possibilities for being affected, we increase our own power to affect in return. Integrating movement in the site of a creative practice, “thinking-feeling” in order to “activate the conceptual at work in the pre-articulation of the experiential”._

Those practices led my thinking and developed a dialogue between the movement practices and a process of constantly re-thinking, through movement and speech, in the doing. The score Moving~Thinking is this practice of thinking and speaking through and alongside movement and sensation.

**Actual digital space.**

The point above will offer a blueprint for exploration of the choreographic meaning: How can we become aware of our own bodies/movements? In parallel, to think how can we find alternatives to fixed ways of building space/time and movement qualities on web design environments? Leading to a reflection on ‘Programming and being programmed’; moving away from pre-chroeographed systems, moving towards building our ow choreographies.

Time dedicated to the experimentation (short critical reflections) using digital interfaces/ web-design tools. 

To explore the use of choreographic techniques as a way to reflect and find alternative paths towards the use of tools, systems of visuality, accessibility, and distribution of information.

##Theoretical Approach:

Introduction to choreographic concepts (theoretical context): references to works by choreographers and/or performers: showing films and scores as examples. 

Discuss the possible relations of choreography to design/technology (current circumstances). Conceptual thinking.

A critical and exploratory approach to how the human movement, perception and embodiment work may give design new pointers.

##Planning

Thursday 21st July 2016 - from 5:30 pm to 8:30 pm.

    Viewpoints of time (tempo, duration, rhythmic structures).

Friday 22nd July 2016 - from 5:30 pm to 8:30 pm.

    Viewpoints of space (spatial dimensions, relationships, and intensities).

Thursday 28th July 2016 - from 5:30 pm to 8:30 pm.

    Kinesthetic experiments (dynamics / mobility / stability/ simultaneity..). 

Friday 29th July 2016 - from 5:30 pm to 8:30 pm.

    Improvisation techniques (repetition / variation / accumulation / substitution / elements of chance).


**Location: Cantina.**

So far my [research and experiments](http://pzwart1.wdka.hro.nl/%7Ejo/notebook/series/glossary.html) have been based on Post-Modern Dance ("..it was a moment of questioning what the elements of dance were.")

Following the above, as an inspirational source we will be looking at choreographers who belonged to the post-modern movement in dance, originators of radical and highly experimental performance practices, bringing new formal and aesthetic innovation to the dance field. I will mainly refer to those particularly related to the Judson Dance Theater in New York, in the early 60´s. This was a great period for collaboration between dancers, composers, and visual artists who were involved in avant-garde experiences and who established the presets for the post-modern movement (Siegmund et al., 2013, p.190). Particularly practices by the american choreographer and filmmaker Yvonne Rainer; Merce Cunningham, an american choreographer, who often collaborated with John Cage and together experimented with ‘chance operations’ in various compositions, “the term ‘chance’, ‘indeterminacy’, and ‘aleatory’ have all been used to describe the use of random procedures in composition, the variability of performance, or both.” (Pritchett, 1993); the belgium choreographer Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker; and Wiiliam Foresythe, the most contemporary approach, for his interest and commitment with technology.

Esoteric programming languages, also called esolang, are used when writing software, integrating a new grammar to the existing one. Although an esolang doesn’t have a proper functionality, it is used in combination with other programming languages to explore alternative ways of composing and writing code. Another advantage of esolang, is the fact that it allows for a minimalistic set of instructions based on key terms, in these case relating to the predefined choreographic parameters from the design composition.
